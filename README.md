- Equipment 装备
  - The essential equipment for playing badminton is the racket and the shoes. For beginners, the choice of racket doesn't need to be overly complicated; simply choose one that you like. If you're just participating in the weekly badminton activities of KIAA, you don't necessarily need to purchase a racket. Considering the specific movements in badminton such as sudden stops, sprints, and lateral movements, having specialized badminton shoes becomes crucial as they can effectively prevent injuries. Therefore, it's recommended that those who plan to play long-term invest in a pair of badminton shoes.
  - 打羽毛球的装备主要是球拍和球鞋。球拍对于新手来说不需要过多的考虑，买一把自己喜欢的就行。如果只是参加KIAA每周的羽毛球活动，不买球拍也行。考虑到羽毛球这项运动的特殊性，比如急停急跑以及横向移动，专业的羽毛球鞋就显得很重要了，因为球鞋可以有效的防止受伤。所以建议有长期打球计划的同学买一双球鞋。

# Part II. KIAA 羽毛球俱乐部积分赛规则（2023年11月版）

1. 初始积分为2023年KIAA杯前所定的rank\*10（已公布）。**后加入积分挑战赛者根据第一局结果确定初始积分，此局对手积分不变。**
2. **积分将用于每年KIAA杯羽毛球赛分组与赛制制定。**
3. 双方比赛前需都承认此为积分挑战赛，比赛后将结果发给黄齐丰/傅淑琦更新积分。
4. **单打积分规则：**
 - step1：根据双方积分预测比赛结果。积分差每增加10，预测比赛结果分差增加4
（例如积分差为10，预测结果为21-17；积分差为20，预测结果21-13；积分差为30，预测结果21-9，依此类推）。
 - step2：将实际结果与预测结果相减（例如预测为13-21，实际为17-21，那么得到4），再乘以放大系数 K 即为本局赛后选手分数变化值。其中 K＝2-0.01\*赛前积分。
 - 比分大于21则记为21。
 - 若赛前双方积分差大于40则积分赛无效。
5. **双打积分规则：**
分别计算双方赛前平均积分，将平均积分代入单打积分规则，计算赛后双方平均积分变化值。最终每人的积分变化＝本方平均积分变化值 * 0.5
6. 积分最低为0，上限为200。

## KIAA Badminton Club Rank Competition Rules (November 2023 Edition)

1. The initial ranks are the rank*10 set before the 2023 KIAA Cup (already announced). **Those who join the rank challenge will determine their initial ranks based on the results of the first game, and the opponent's points will remain unchanged in this game**
2. **Ranks will be used for the grouping of the annual KIAA Cup badminton tournament**
3. Both parties must acknowledge this as a rank challenge before the games, and the results will be sent to Huang Qifeng/Fu Shuqi for updated ranks after the games.
4. **Rule of Singles:**
- Step 1: Predict the match result based on the ranks of both sides. For every 10 points increase in the difference in ranks, the predicted match result difference will increase by 4 points
(For example, if the rank difference is 10, the predicted result is 21-17; if the rank difference is 20, the predicted result is 21-13; if the rank difference is 30, the predicted result is 21-9, and so on).
- Step 2: Subtract the actual result from the predicted result (for example, if it is predicted to be 13-21 and actual is 17-21, then obtain 4), and multiply it by the amplification factor K to obtain the change in the player's rank after this game. Among them, K=2-0.01 * pre match ranks.
- If the score is greater than 21, it is recorded as 21.
- If the difference in ranks between the two sides before the competition is greater than 40, the rank competition will be invalid.
5. **Rule of Doubles:**
Calculate the average rank of both sides before the competition, substitute the average ranks into the Rule of Singles, and calculate the change in average rank of both sides after the competition. The final change in ranks for each person = the average change in points for our side * 0.5
6. The minimum rank is 0, and the upper limit is 200.
